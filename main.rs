//Stack & Heap (extract from THE book)
// The stack stores values in the order it gets them and removes the values in the opposite order. This is referred to as last in, first out.
// Adding data is called pushing onto the stack, and removing data is called popping off the stack. All data stored on the stack must have a known, fixed size.
// Data with an unknown size at compile time or a size that might change must be stored on the heap instead.
// The heap is less organized: when you put data on the heap, you request a certain amount of space.
// The memory allocator finds an empty spot in the heap that is big enough, marks it as being in use, and returns a pointer, which is the address of that location.
// This process is called allocating on the heap and is sometimes abbreviated as just allocating (pushing values onto the stack is not considered allocating).
// Because the pointer to the heap is a known, fixed size, you can store the pointer on the stack, but when you want the actual data, you must follow the pointer.
//Pushing to the stack is faster than allocating on the heap because the allocator never has to search for a place to store new data;
// that location is always at the top of the stack.

//When your code calls a function, the values passed into the function (including, potentially, pointers to data on the heap)
// and the functionâ€™s local variables get pushed onto the stack.
// When the function is over, those values get popped off the stack.

//Rust ownership in short :
// Each value in Rust has an owner.
// There can only be one owner at a time.
// When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.
